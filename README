dwh wrapper - a data warehouse wrapper script for use with Teradata utilities

provides a cli to teradata bteq and other utilities to allow:
* easy execution of scripts/SQL queries from the command line
* download to csv (and binary) format without third-party conversion tools
* upload from csv (and binary) format without third-party conversion tools

Requires: python 2.6, Teradata linux_cliv2, Teradata BTEQ
Optional: Teradata fastexp, fastld and mload

Tested using Teradata utilities version 13

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Installation (Linux)

Make sure you have the Teradata linux cliv2 and bteq installed.

1. unzip the archive

2. run the install command: 

system-wide:
$ sudo python setup.py install

user-only:
$ python setyp.py install --user

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Logon credentials

Default credentials are read from '~/.odbc.ini'. For example, your ~/.odbc.ini
might contain the following:

    [dwh32]
    DBCName=dbc
    Username=USERID
    Password=PASSWORD


By default, the script looks for a section called 'DWH32' and takes the dbcname,
username and password from there and uses those details to connect to the
Teradata machine.

You can specify another section from your ~/.odbc.ini to use with the -d or --dbc
command line options. If ~/.odbc.ini is not found, the default 'dbc' is used and
your current username is used, and you will be prompted for your dbc password.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Usage

The default mode is script/query execution mode. For example:


$ dwh 'select current_time'

    dwh 'select current_date'
    --- executing bteq at 2012-02-14 12:10:58
    --- bteq execution completed. elapsed time: 0:00:01.862359
    ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
    
    select current_date
    
     *** Query completed. One row found. One column returned. 
     *** Total elapsed time was 1 second.
    
        Date
    --------
    12/02/14
    
     *** BTEQ exiting due to EOF on stdin.
    
     *** Exiting BTEQ...
     *** RC (return code) = 0 


You can specify a script to execute instead:

$ dwh script.sql

Which will read 'script.sql' and execute the entire contents against the dbc




The second use mode is download, or 'get' mode:

$ dwh get output.csv 'select * from MYDB.MYTABLE'

This will download the returned rows from the sql statement in binary bteq format
and convert it to csv, saving the output in 'output.csv'

$ dwh get -h
    will list the available options to use with the get/download command.



The third use mode is upload, or 'put' mode:

$ dwh put MYDB.MYTABLE input.csv

This will read the csv file 'input.csv' and convert the contents to Teradata
binary format based on the column definitions from MYDB.MYTABLE. Note that for
every column header in the csv file there must be a corresponding column in
MYDB.MYTABLE.

$ dwh put -h
    will list the available options to use with the put/upload command




The fourth use mode is table mode:

$ dwh table input.csv

This is an experimental mode (and probably has more bugs than the other modes)
which will scan input.csv and generate a CREATE TABLE sql statement - useful if
you want to upload a csv file, but don't have a table created already on the
warehouse - the script attempts to guess the correct definitions and data types
for each csv column - you are advised to check that they make sense!



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Warnings

* This script is in BETA currently - it probably contains bugs, and you should
  check that any data you upload or download from your dbc has been converted
  correctly
  
* Upon running setup.py install, a python file is generated <dbcarea.py> which
  serves as the interface between the dbcwrapper and the Teradata cliv2 library.
  This is architecture dependent, and our testing has been done on a 64bit intel
  system. Users on other architectures want to beware (we have not tested other
  architectures).
  
* We assume we're working with LATIN character set ISO8859-1
